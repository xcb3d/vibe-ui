/**
 * Vibe UI Combined Styles
 * All styles combined for runtime switching using data-style attribute
 * Import this file to enable multi-style support in docs/preview apps
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Each theme folder is self-contained (variables + component overrides)
 * - User generating components only needs their chosen theme's globals.css
 * - This combined.css is for docs app to preview all themes
